# d&d point buy system

I thought about using the Ren'Py game engine to create a D&D fangame, then thought maybe I could add a character stat creation screen to customize the experience further (to Baldurify it, if you must), and decided to create that first before starting on the game! 

This is a very simple way of doing point buy, with a total of 27 points you can use to "buy" points in the six stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma). There's a display option where your stats are presented in a table, a change option to edit one stat at a time, and then a reset option in case you wanted to use it further but didn't run to run the whole program again.

Hope this entertains you as much as it did me while coding it!
